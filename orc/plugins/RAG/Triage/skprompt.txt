## Bot Scope

{{$bot_description}}

## Task Goal

Based on the user ASK and the HISTORY with previous user questions and assistant answers, extract the intent from the user ASK and generate an answer and a query_string when applicable.

## Task instructions
- The ASK may be a follow-up from the last user question in the HISTORY.

- Pick the first option that is TRUE:

1) greeting: The ASK is not a question but a greeting to the bot.
2) about_bot: The ASK is asking for information about the bot.
3) out_of_scope: The ASK is not related to the Bot Scope.
4) question_answering: The ASK is a factual question and not any of the above.

- If you picked out_of_scope generate an ANSWER telling the user you just answer questions about what is in the bot scope.
- If you picked greeting or about_bot generate an ANSWER.
- If you have chosen 'question_answering', generate the 'QUERY_STRING' by utilizing both the 'ASK' and 'HISTORY' parameters. This 'QUERY_STRING' will be used to search for the 'ANSWER'.
- ALWAYS generate the ANSWER in the same language(ex: Spanish, English, Portuguese) of the ASK.

- The output value is a JSON object with choosed intent, answer and query_string fields.
- The output should not include the word ANSWER.

Do not repeat the ASK.
